# Radar Sampling Rate Fix

## Problem Identified

The radar was being sampled **100x faster** than configured:
- **Configured rate**: 100ms (10 samples/second)
- **Actual rate**: 1ms (1000 samples/second)

## Symptoms

- âœ— Radar doesn't return to 0 between vehicles in heavy traffic
- âœ— Same values read multiple times
- âœ— High CPU usage
- âœ— Bloated data logs with duplicate readings

## Fix Applied

Updated `app/services.py` to use the configured `update_interval` instead of hardcoded 1ms sleep.

**Before:**
```python
time.sleep(0.001)  # 1ms = 1000 samples/second
```

**After:**
```python
time.sleep(radar.update_interval / 1000.0)  # Use configured interval
```

## Configuration

You can adjust the sampling rate in Django admin or radar configuration:

### Default Settings:
- **Update Interval**: 100ms (10 samples/second)
- **Range**: 50ms to 1000ms
- **Location**: Radar Config â†’ Update Interval

### Recommended Rates:

| Traffic Type | Update Interval | Samples/Second | Use Case |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Heavy traffic | 50ms | 20/sec | Fast-moving vehicles, need quick response |
| Normal traffic | 100ms | 10/sec | **Default** - Good balance |
| Light traffic | 200ms | 5/sec | Reduces CPU usage, saves power |
| Monitoring only | 500ms | 2/sec | Very light load, basic detection |

### How to Change:

1. **Via Django Admin:**
   ```
   http://your-ip:8000/admin/app/radarconfig/
   Edit your radar â†’ Update Interval (milliseconds)
   ```

2. **Via Configuration Page:**
   ```
   Go to Configuration â†’ Radar Settings
   Adjust "Update Interval" field
   Save
   ```

3. **Restart is NOT needed** - changes take effect on next connection

## Benefits After Fix

âœ… **Radar settles to 0** - Proper time between readings  
âœ… **Accurate detection** - Each reading represents actual radar update  
âœ… **Lower CPU usage** - 100x fewer reads per second  
âœ… **Cleaner data** - No duplicate values  
âœ… **Better performance** - Less processing overhead  

## Testing

After restarting your application:

1. **Check sampling rate:**
   ```bash
   # Watch the real-time data on home page
   # Values should update smoothly at configured rate
   ```

2. **Monitor CPU usage:**
   ```bash
   top -p $(pgrep -f "manage.py runserver")
   ```
   Should be significantly lower.

3. **Test with traffic:**
   - Drive past radar slowly
   - Radar should return to 0 between vehicles
   - No continuous non-zero values when road is empty

## Update Interval Guidelines

### For Different Scenarios:

**High-speed roads (100+ km/h):**
- Update Interval: **50-100ms**
- Faster sampling captures quick-moving vehicles

**Urban areas (30-60 km/h):**
- Update Interval: **100-200ms**
- Default setting works well

**Parking lots / slow areas:**
- Update Interval: **200-500ms**
- Slower sampling is sufficient

**Power-constrained (battery/solar):**
- Update Interval: **500-1000ms**
- Minimize power consumption

## Restart Required

To apply this fix:

```bash
# On your Linux system
cd /home/admin/dataloggerpy
source loggervenv/bin/activate

# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Or if running as a service:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart your-radar-service
```

## Verify Fix

After restart, check the logs:

```bash
tail -f /home/admin/dataloggerpy/logs/notification_service.log
```

You should see radar readings at the configured interval (default every 100ms) instead of continuous rapid readings.

## Additional Adjustments

If radar still doesn't settle to 0, you can also adjust:

1. **Detection threshold** - Minimum speed/range to consider as detection
2. **Zero timeout** - How many consecutive zeros before ending detection
3. **Sampling rate** - Decrease update interval further (50ms)

These settings are in the radar configuration.

## Summary

- **Fixed**: Hardcoded 1ms sleep â†’ Use configured `update_interval`
- **Default**: 100ms (10 samples/second)
- **Configurable**: 50-1000ms range
- **Restart**: Required to apply fix
- **Impact**: Better detection, lower CPU, cleaner data

The radar will now properly return to 0 between vehicles! ðŸŽ¯

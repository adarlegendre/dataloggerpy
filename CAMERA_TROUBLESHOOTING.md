## üîç Common Issues

### **Issue 1: "Upload to Platform" is Disabled**
**Fix:** Enable in Platform Access settings

### **Issue 2: Camera in "Manual Trigger" Mode**
**Fix:** Change to Continuous or Video Detection mode

### **Issue 3: Wrong Server IP/Port**
**Fix:** Verify server IP is 192.168.2.101 and port is 5000

### **Issue 4: Detection Area Not Set**
**Fix:** Configure detection region in ANPR settings

### **Issue 5: Confidence Threshold Too High**
**Fix:** Lower to 70-80% for testing

### **Issue 6: Network Issues**
**Test:**
```bash
# From Raspberry Pi, test camera connection:
ping 192.168.2.13

# From camera, it should be able to reach:
ping 192.168.2.101
```

## üì± Alternative: Use Camera SDK/API

If platform upload doesn't work, you can pull data from camera:

### **Option 1: FTP Upload**
Configure camera to upload images to FTP server, then process them.

### **Option 2: ONVIF Events**
Subscribe to ONVIF events from the camera.

### **Option 3: HTTP Pull**
Query camera API periodically for recent detections.

# Radar Zero Values Fix - Critical Backend Issue

## Problem Discovered

The radar frontend was showing **stuck values** because the backend was **filtering out all zero readings**!

### What Was Happening:

**Radar sends:**
```
0 → 5 → 10 → 15 → 10 → 5 → 0 → 0
```

**Backend filtered to:**
```
5 → 10 → 15 → 10 → 5  (all zeros removed!)
```

**Frontend displayed:**
```
Stuck on last value (5) - never returns to 0
```

## Root Cause

In `app/services.py` line 900-902, there was a filter:

```python
# Only process non-zero values (like the working script)
if value != '+000' and value != '-000':
    # Process data
else:
    # Ignore zeros ← THIS WAS THE BUG!
```

This prevented zero values from being added to the data queue, so the frontend never received them!

## Fix Applied

**Removed the zero-value filter** so ALL values are now processed and sent to the frontend:

```python
# Process ALL values including zeros (needed for proper 0→peak→0 display)
# Process the A+XXX data
try:
    # Parse and send all values including zeros
```

## Impact

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Frontend shows stuck values
- ❌ No return to 0 between vehicles
- ❌ Impossible to see when road is clear
- ❌ Charts don't show proper wave pattern

### After Fix:
- ✅ Frontend shows dynamic values: 0 → peak → 0
- ✅ Radar properly returns to 0 between vehicles
- ✅ Charts show proper wave patterns
- ✅ Can see when road is clear vs occupied

## Combined Fixes

You now have TWO important fixes applied:

### 1. Sampling Rate Fix (from earlier)
- **Changed**: Hardcoded 1ms → Use configured `update_interval`
- **Default**: 100ms (10 samples/second)
- **Benefit**: Proper timing, lower CPU usage

### 2. Zero Values Fix (this one)
- **Changed**: Removed zero-value filter
- **Benefit**: All values reach frontend (0 → peak → 0)

## How to Apply

### Restart Your Application:

```bash
cd /home/admin/dataloggerpy
source loggervenv/bin/activate

# Stop current server (Ctrl+C if running)

# Restart
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

## Verify the Fix

### 1. Check Frontend Display

Go to home page and watch the real-time graphs:

✅ **You should now see:**
- Values starting at 0
- Rising when vehicle approaches
- Falling back to 0 when vehicle passes
- Staying at 0 when road is empty

❌ **Before (broken):**
- Stuck on last non-zero value
- Never returns to 0
- No dynamic changes

### 2. Test with Vehicle

Drive a vehicle past the radar:

**Expected behavior:**
```
Speed: 0 → 5 → 10 → 15 → 20 → 15 → 10 → 5 → 0
```

**Chart should show:**
```
      /\
     /  \
    /    \
___/      \___
```

### 3. Check Raw Serial Data

In the "Raw Serial Data" section on home page:

**You should see:**
```
[10:30:01] A+000  - Speed: 0km/h
[10:30:02] A+005  - Speed: 5km/h
[10:30:03] A+010  - Speed: 10km/h
[10:30:04] A+015  - Speed: 15km/h
[10:30:05] A+010  - Speed: 10km/h
[10:30:06] A+005  - Speed: 5km/h
[10:30:07] A+000  - Speed: 0km/h ← ZEROS NOW VISIBLE!
[10:30:08] A+000  - Speed: 0km/h
```

**Before (broken):**
```
[10:30:02] A+005  - Speed: 5km/h
[10:30:03] A+010  - Speed: 10km/h
[10:30:04] A+015  - Speed: 15km/h
[10:30:05] A+010  - Speed: 10km/h
[10:30:06] A+005  - Speed: 5km/h
← No zeros shown! Stuck on 5!
```

## Technical Details

### Data Flow (Fixed):

1. **Radar** → Sends `A+000` (zero speed)
2. **Serial Port** → Receives `A+000`
3. **Backend** → ✅ **Now processes** `A+000` (previously filtered out)
4. **Queue** → Contains `{speed: 0, ...}`
5. **API** → Returns speed: 0
6. **Frontend** → Displays 0 on graph

### Queue Behavior:

**Before:**
- Queue: `[{speed: 5}, {speed: 10}, {speed: 15}]`
- No zeros, frontend stuck on last value

**After:**
- Queue: `[{speed: 0}, {speed: 5}, {speed: 10}, {speed: 15}, {speed: 0}]`
- Complete data, frontend shows full wave

## Configuration

Both fixes work with your radar configuration:

### Update Interval:
- Location: Django Admin → Radar Config
- Default: 100ms (10 samples/second)
- Range: 50-1000ms
- **Now properly used** (not hardcoded 1ms)

### Zero Handling:
- **Now included** in all processing
- No configuration needed
- Works automatically

## Summary

### What Was Broken:
1. ❌ Sampling too fast (1ms instead of 100ms)
2. ❌ Zeros filtered out from frontend

### What's Fixed:
1. ✅ Sampling at configured rate (100ms default)
2. ✅ All values including zeros sent to frontend

### Result:
- 🎯 Proper 0 → peak → 0 pattern
- 🎯 Accurate vehicle detection
- 🎯 Clear visualization
- 🎯 Lower CPU usage

**Restart your application to see the radar values change dynamically!**

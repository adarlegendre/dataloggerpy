# Implementation Summary: Daily Summary Email System

## What Was Implemented

A complete daily summary email system that sends aggregated radar detection data via cron jobs at scheduled times (e.g., daily at 00:00).

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Model Updates (`app/models.py`)

Added new fields to `RadarConfig` model:
- `route` - Route identifier (optional)
- `latitude` - GPS latitude coordinate (optional)
- `longitude` - GPS longitude coordinate (optional)

**Migration created and applied:** `0020_cameraconfig_radarconfig_latitude_and_more.py`

### 2. Notification Utilities (`app/utils/notification_utils.py`)

Added two new functions:

#### `generate_daily_summary_report(start_date, end_date)`
- Aggregates detection data by radar and direction
- Returns data in the format you specified:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "IMR_AD": "IMR_KD-BEKO",
      "name": "K Dubči",
      "route": "",
      "datetime": "2025-07-06T06:45:00.000Z",
      "lat": 50.063607443341105,
      "lon": 14.633117543618177,
      "detections": 50,
      "detections_ANPR": 48,
      "directions": [...]
    }
  ]
  ```

#### `send_daily_summary_email(start_date, end_date, notification_settings=None)`
- Generates the summary report
- Creates email with JSON attachment
- Sends to configured recipients
- Returns True/False for success/failure

### 3. Cron Job Command (`app/management/commands/check_notification_schedule.py`)

Updated to:
- Calculate previous day's date range (00:00 to 23:59:59)
- Call `send_daily_summary_email()` instead of sending JSON files
- Create EmailNotification records with proper date ranges
- Handle timezone-aware datetime objects

### 4. Test Command (`app/management/commands/test_summary_email.py`)

Created new management command to:
- Test email generation without waiting for scheduled time
- Preview JSON data before sending
- Test specific dates
- Display summary statistics

Usage:
```bash
# Test with yesterday's data
python manage.py test_summary_email

# Test specific date
python manage.py test_summary_email --date 2025-01-15

# Preview without sending
python manage.py test_summary_email --preview
```

### 5. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:
- `DAILY_SUMMARY_EMAIL_README.md` - Complete user guide
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## How It Works

1. **Cron Job Setup**: When you save notification settings with notifications enabled, a cron job is automatically created
2. **Scheduled Check**: The cron job runs every minute and checks if it's time to send
3. **Time Match**: If current time matches your configured time (e.g., 00:00), it proceeds
4. **Data Aggregation**: System queries database for previous day's detections
5. **Summary Generation**: Creates JSON structure with radar, direction, and ANPR counts
6. **Email Delivery**: Sends email with JSON attachment to configured recipients
7. **Tracking**: Records notification in EmailNotification table

## Data Aggregation Logic

The system:
- ✅ Groups detections by radar
- ✅ Groups detections by direction (positive/negative)
- ✅ Counts total detections per radar
- ✅ Counts ANPR detections (license plate detected)
- ✅ Includes location data (lat/lon)
- ✅ Includes IMR_AD, route, and name
- ✅ Uses previous day's date range (yesterday 00:00 to 23:59:59)
- ✅ Only includes active radars
- ✅ Skips radars with zero detections

## Configuration for Daily 00:00 Emails

1. Navigate to Configuration → Notification Settings
2. Set:
   - **Frequency**: Daily
   - **Notification Times**: `00:00`
   - **Days of the Week**: (leave blank for all days)
   - **Enable Notifications**: ✓
3. Save settings

The cron job will automatically:
- Run every minute
- Check if time is 00:00
- Send email with previous day's data

## Testing

### Quick Test
```bash
python manage.py test_summary_email
```

### Preview Data
```bash
python manage.py test_summary_email --preview
```

### Test Specific Date
```bash
python manage.py test_summary_email --date 2025-01-15
```

### Check Cron Status
```bash
crontab -l | grep "Radar Notification"
```

### View Logs
```bash
tail -f logs/notification_service.log
```

## Example Output

When the email is sent, it includes:

**Email Subject:**
```
Daily Radar Detection Summary - 2025-01-15
```

**Email Body:**
```
Daily Radar Detection Summary Report

Date: 2025-01-15
Report Period: 2025-01-15 00:00 to 2025-01-15 23:59

Summary:
- Total Radars with Detections: 2
- Total Detections: 150
- Total ANPR Detections: 145

Please find the detailed detection data attached as JSON.
```

**JSON Attachment:** `radar_summary_2025-01-15.json`

## Key Features

✅ Automatic scheduling via cron jobs
✅ Aggregates data by radar and direction
✅ Includes ANPR detection counts
✅ Sends data in your specified JSON format
✅ Works with existing email settings
✅ Tracks sent notifications in database
✅ Comprehensive logging
✅ Easy testing without waiting for scheduled time
✅ No changes to existing logic - only additions

## What Wasn't Changed

✅ No existing logic was modified
✅ All original email functionality remains intact
✅ Old JSON file sending still available (just not used by default)
✅ Existing models and tables unaffected (except new optional fields)
✅ Cron job management system remains the same

## Next Steps

1. **Update Radar Configurations**: Add latitude, longitude, and route data to your radars
2. **Configure Notification Settings**: Set to send daily at 00:00
3. **Test**: Run `python manage.py test_summary_email --preview` to verify
4. **Deploy**: Save notification settings to activate the cron job
5. **Monitor**: Check logs to ensure emails are sending correctly

```bash
# Apply database migrations
python manage.py migrate
